# 3D PacMan 
3D PacMan is a game I made with JavaScript and WebGL for a computer graphics course.

Tested on Google Chrome. On Firefox there can be problems with some sound effects.

## Controls:
- Movement with arrow keys
- Space for jumping (it's possible to jump over enemies, but not over walls)
